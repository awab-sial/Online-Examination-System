## 📌 Overview

**AI-Enhanced Online Examination System** is a smart, adaptive testing platform built with **C++ and Qt**, designed as a semester project for the **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** course at **Bahria University**.

The system integrates **OpenAI GPT-3** to dynamically generate questions and evaluate answers based on difficulty. It supports adaptive testing, question skipping/reattempting, group chat, and saves user exam data in local files — all within a clean and user-friendly GUI.

## ✨ Features

- 🧠 **GPT-3 Powered** question generation and checking
- 🔄 **Adaptive Difficulty** based on user performance
- ⏭️ **Skip and Reattempt Questions**
- 💬 **Group Chat** for exam collaboration
- 📁 **User Data Storage** in text files
- 🖥️ **Modern GUI** built with Qt
- 🔐 **Secure File-based Tracking** of name, subject, difficulty

## 🧱 Project Goals

- Design an interactive GUI-based exam environment  
- Use AI (GPT-3) to auto-generate and evaluate questions  
- Enable users to skip/reattempt questions intelligently  
- Persist user data and settings in local storage  
- Offer adaptive difficulty features for personalized testing

## 🔍 Project Scope

- Adaptive online exam system powered by GPT-3  
- File handling using DSA concepts (arrays, trees, file streams)  
- Exam content and difficulty management  
- Group chat communication support  
- GUI interactions for full examination lifecycle  

---

## 🛠️ Project Requirements

- Generate and show questions per user-selected difficulty  
- Use `json.hpp` to call GPT-3 API for question/answer processing  
- Store user’s name, subject, and difficulty in a file  
- Allow real-time question skipping and retry  
- GUI flow for login, question-answering, result summary
